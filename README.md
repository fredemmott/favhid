# FAVHID

Fred's Arduino Virtual HID (FAVHID) is a sketch (program) for the Arduino Micro that accepts USB HID descriptors and reports over the USB-serial interface, and reflects them as actual HID devices and reports.

This allows it to be used as a more flexible alternative to vJoy.

You probably want to look at the [FAVHID-Client repository](https://github.com/fredemmott/favhid-client) instead.
